# AI-Line-Following-Robot
The line follower is a self operating robot that detects and follows a line that is drawn on the floor. The path consists of a black line on a white surface (or it may be reverse of that). The control system used must sense a line and maneuver the robot to stay on course, while constantly correcting the wrong moves using feedback mechanism, thus forming a simple yet effective closed loop System. The robot is designed to follow very tight curves. Sensing a line and maneuvering the robot to stay on course, while constantly correcting wrong moves using feedback mechanism forms a Simple yet effective closed loop system. As a programmer you get an Opportunity to ‘teach’ the robot how to follow the line thus giving it aHuman-like property of responding to stimuli. Practical applications of a line follower: Automated cars running on Roads with embedded magnets; guidance system for industrial robots moving on shop floor etc.
